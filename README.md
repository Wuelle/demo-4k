## Usage
Since building this can be a bit of a pain, i also uploaded the final executable as `final.exe`.
A (low quality) recording of the demo can also be found on [Odysee](https://odysee.com/2024-01-14-19-09-10:e).

If you *do* want to build this yourself, run
```
build.bat
```
(Put crinkler somewhere where it can be found)

You need to compile `core`, since the default version contains code for
`panic=unwind`, which would require you to provide a few more symbols.
